# MusicPlayer
Functional but WIP offline music player as a forms app. Basic functions such as shuffle, forward, back, pause/play and volume adjustment.
Currently only offline audio files. Shows cover image and details if audio file has metadata.

//TODO: Add to Settings: EQ, File Storage as an option, Playlists.

//TODO: Add a search function and add songs straight from Youtube just with a name search and rip metadata from Spotify
